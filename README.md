## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version 6.x or later) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (version 1.x or later)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or if you prefer yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

## Running the Application

1. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    or if you prefer yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

2. The server will start and listen on the port specified in your configuration. By default, it is `http://localhost:3000`.
